# Drag and Drop Image Puzzle

This is a web application that allows users to play a drag and drop image puzzle game. The game presents an image divided into several pieces, and the user's objective is to rearrange the pieces by dragging and dropping them until the original image is restored.

## Features

- Drag and drop functionality: Users can click and drag puzzle pieces to move them around the screen.
- Puzzle difficulty levels: Users can choose from different difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard, which determine the number of puzzle pieces and the complexity of the image division.
- Image selection: Users can select from a collection of images or upload their own images to use in the puzzle.
- Timer: The game tracks the time taken by the user to complete the puzzle.
- Hint option: Users can request a hint to help them solve the puzzle. The hint highlights the correct position for one puzzle piece.
- Score tracking: The application keeps track of the user's best times for each difficulty level.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Used for the front-end development of the application.
- Drag and drop API: Leveraged to implement the drag and drop functionality.
- Image processing libraries (optional): If needed, image processing libraries can be used to divide the image into puzzle pieces.
- Backend technologies (optional): If you have implemented any server-side functionality, mention the technologies used here.
